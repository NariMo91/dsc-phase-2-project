    "## Overview\n",
    "This project is a multiple linear regression analysis of housing data from King County, where multiple features about homes are used to predict housing processes. A regression model should help King Realty advise homeowners on how to increase the estimated values of their homes through renovation, and by what amount. "

    "## Data Cleaning/Scrubbing\n",
    "#### Datatypes and missing values\n",
    "The original data from `data/kc_house_data.csv` contained 21597 entries with missing values in `waterfront`, `view`, and `yr_renovated`. Furthermore, `date` and `sqft_basement` were stored as objects. `sqft_basement` contained '?' as a placeholder value. Strategies for dealing with missing/anamolous values and unworkable datatypes included the following:\n",
    "- `date`: convered to datetime object in order to extract `month` (the month a property was sold) and `yr_sold`.\n",
    "- `sqft_basement`: replaced '?' with 0.0, which is the most common value for this feature (~59%). 0.0 suggests the home does not have a basement. The datatype was then converted to float.\n",
    "- `waterfront`: imputed missing values based on the value counts of existing values. \n",
    "- `view`: imputed missing values with the median 0.0, which suggests there isn't much of a view.\n",
    "- `yr_renovated`: imputed missing values with the median 0.0, which suggests the home was not renovated. 96% of homes were never renovated. I assumed that homes with no record of renovation have never been renovated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature engineering\n",
    "New temporal features were created from the date sold, as well as new property feature. These new features included:\n",
    "- `yr_sold`: the year a property was sold.\n",
    "- `month`: the month a property was sold.\n",
    "- `yrs_since_reno`: the number of years since the a home has been renovated at the time of its most recent sale (yr_sold - yr_renovated = yrs_since_reno).\n",
    "- `bed_bath_ratio`: the number of bedrooms divided by the number of bedrooms.\n",
    "- `cities`: offered broader and fewer categories than `zipcode`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drop duplicates\n",
    "`id` is a unique identifier for a home, and duplicate ids imply a home has been sold multiple times. Since the data was already sorted by date, duplicates were dropped while keeping only the most recent sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### City boundaries for folium\n",
    "`Cities and Unincorporated King County` contained shape information for cities in King County, some of which were not present in the sales dataset. When there were cities in the geodata that were not included in the main dataset, folium blacked out these areas. In order to avoid this, the unmatched cities needed to be removed from the geojson file."

    "## EDA\n",
    "#### Temporal data\n",
    "`yr_sold` did not too heplful for a model, as the data only contained sales for 2014 and 2015. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examining `month` showed that more homes are sold in the early spring to summer months. Based on the descriptive statistics for the dataset, you could get about 30K-40K more for a home by waiting to sell in May-July.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/count-month.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, looking at plots of price v. month, there aren't any particular months where homes are sold for more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Waterfront\n",
    "Homes with a waterfront tend to sell for much more than homes without a waterfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/waterfront.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Year renovated\n",
    "There have been more renovations in more recent years. This might be because the number of homes in the county has increased over the years. In any case, home renovation seems to be an increasingly important factor in improving home value over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/count-yr-renovated.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Years since renovation\n",
    "Again, `yrs_since_reno` is the years since renovation at the time of a home's most recent sale. Homes with fewer years between their sale date and their last renovation tend to sell for more. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### Histograms of data\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/histograms-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributions of many columns are skewed ('price', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'sqft_above', 'sqft_living15', 'sqft_lot15'). This helped to identify data that would benefit from log-transformations down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scatterplots of price v. features\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/scatterplots-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'grade', 'sqft_above', 'sqft_living15', grade seemed to have the most linear relationships with price. There were outliers in some of the predictors:  \n",
    "- `bedrooms`: a low pricced property with over 30 bedrooms. I've assumed this was likely a mistake entry.\n",
    "- `bathrooms`: high and low priced properties with over 6 bathrooms\n",
    "- `price`: outliers beyond 6M\n",
    "- outliers in sqft data\n",
    "\n",
    "Some scatter plots have maxima in the middle of the plots, where there may be a positive correlation up to a certain value of the predictor variable, followed by a negative correlation. Features showing this pattern could benefit from binning into more categories/subfeatures. `bedrooms` is the most obvious example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bedrooms\n",
    "After removing some outliers, a closer look at `price` v. `bedrooms` revealed that the relationship changes from positive to negative and that the data would benefit from binning.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/bedrooms.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a positive relationship between bedrooms and price up to 5 bedrooms, then there is a slight negative relationship with price (or at the very least, the relationship changes). The relationship between `sqft_living` and `bedrooms` showed that the amount of living space tapers off as the number of bedrooms increases. This means that the homes are more cramped beyond a certain number of bedrooms, which probably contributes to the decreasing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/sqftliving-bedrooms.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### View\n",
    "Homes with better views have higher values for this feature. Views with a value of 1.0 and 2.0 were binned together based on the closeness of their median price.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/price-view.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Condition\n",
    "There seemed to be no significant difference in price between condition values 1 & 2 and 3 & 4, so these categories were binned together.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/price-condition.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Location\n",
    "A chloropleth folium map was created with the sales data and a geojson file named \"Cities and Unincorporated King County\". The chloropleth map shows that the most expensive cities are Kirkland and Mercer Island (not labeled in this map). The least expensive areas are colored pale green. One would expect the quality of any renovations to be most competitive in expensive cities. It may be important to consider the maximum amount of money people are likely to pay in pale-colored cities when determining a renovation budget.\n",

    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "The baseline model contained most of the original data (minus those exhibiting multicolinearity), and included all potential outliers. The following pre-processing decisions were made prior to building this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decisions\n",
    "Removed features due to multicolinearity (0.75 cutoff value):\n",
    "- dropped `sqft_above`, kept `sqft_living`\n",
    "- dropped `yr_sold`, kept `month`\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropped unhelpful features:\n",
    "- `id`: this was good for identifying duplicate homes (homes old more than once), but had little use beyond that.\n",
    "- `date`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diagnostics\n",
    "$R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ were both 0.706. The confidence interval for `month` crossed 0 (possibility of no relationship with the target variable) with a p-value of 0.053, but this feature was kept in case its relevance could improve after further pre-processing of the data.\n",
    "`bedrooms`, `sqft_basement`, `sqft_lot15`, and `yr_built` had negative coefficients, contrary to what one may expect for these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A test-train split of 75/25 was used to evaluate the root mean squared error of training data versus \"unseen\" data. The purpose of this is to test that a model is generalizable to new data, or whether the model is underfit or overfit. This calculation yielded the following results: \n",
    "- Train RMSE: 204049.23830834476\n",
    "- Test RMSE: 185223.8167396286\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Decisions\n",
    "This iteration involved the removal of outliers:\n",
    "- `bedrooms` over 12. \n",
    "- `bed_bath_ratio` over 4. 5 bedrooms to one bathroom does not seem to be a liveable situation for a family or small group. Also, the outlier data disrupts an otherwise nice negative trend.\n",
    "- `bathrooms` under 1. A 0.5 value or half bath is just a powder room, which means no tub or shower.\n",
    "- `price` over 5M. This seemed like a good cutoff value based on the scatterplots of multiple features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature from a pair of highly correlated features was dropped:\n",
    "- Dropped `yr_renovated` and kept `yrs_since_reno`. `yrs_since_reno` was chosen as the preferred feature for this project. This ended up being one of the things I wish to change about the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diagnostics\n",
    "$R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ was 0.711. `bedrooms` and `sqft_basement`, and `sqft_lot15` still had negative coefficients. There were some improved p-values, but the model still violated the assumptions of normality of the residulas and homoscedasticity. A JB value of 302278.875 showed improvement in homoscedasticity compared to the baseline model. The RMSE calculations for a test-train-split were lesser in magnitude and closer together:\n",

Cleaning involved removing duplicate zipcodes and consolidating \"Sammamish\" with \"Sammamiish\" (a misspelling).

    "## Test Case: Reducing bed-bath ratio for homes in Renton\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to see the model in action, so I chose to perform a sample renovation on 23 homes in the dataset to see how the relevant coefficient can be recovered. I did this by reducing the bed-bath ratio of 23 homes in Renton from 4 to 2. These homes also happened to have 1 bathroom, which means that we went from 4 to 2 bedrooms in all homes. This could be the equivalent of merging bedrooms together or knocking out a bedroom to create more living area space. If these homes were being evaluated in 2021 (this year), these additional years would need to be added to `yrs_since_reno`. `yr_sold` is still a necessary piece of data in order to calculate this, even though it isn't fed into the model. I left this alone for the test case and assumed these post-renovation predictions were being made in 2014 or 2015, using the original `yrs_since_reno` data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 2 unit decrease in `bed_bath_ratio`, there is a 6.96% increase in price for the selected Renton homes with a standard deviation of 21%. This works out to be a 3.48% increase in price per unit decrease in `bed_bath_ratio`. The coefficient for `bed_bath_ratio` was -0.0486, which suggests that a 4.86% increase in price could be achieved by a one unit decrease in bed_bath_ratio.

    "The final model could be tuned further in terms of the normality of its residuals, perhaps through the removal of additional outliers that disrupt the linear relationship of X feature with price. Experimenting with additional features to drop versus keep may also lead to improvements in model performance, the qq plot, or RMSE values. Currently, RMSE reveals that the model can be ~$157K off in its predictions of home value, which might not be too much of a problem for very high valued homes (4M+), but is troubling for lesser-valued homes. Therefore, RMSE should be reduced in future iterations. The test case revealed that `yr_renovated` may be a better feature to keep in the model than `yrs_since_reno` in order to avoid the need for additional calculations. I would repeat the modeling process using `yr_renovated` instead. "
